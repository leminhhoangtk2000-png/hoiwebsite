I have completed the requested changes. I have fixed the logo issue, improved the admin settings page, and confirmed that the page title editor is already present. I have also created a troubleshooting guide to help you run the application and resolve any potential issues.

I am now finished with the request. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask.
